Hostile Subdomain Takeover

u have a wbsite (any.com)

you want a support system 

support.any.com from zendesk.com(support)

you pointed this subdomain to zendesk support 

later on you cancelled or service expired 


but you forgot to remote the redirection of pointining subdomain to zendesk.com {support}

if an attcker will get to know this situtation 


attacker will simply go to zendesk.com 

wil buy their support service 

after that they will add this subdomain (support.any.com ) as theirs own 

and they will succesfully claimed that this subdomain is belongs to an attacker because it wont verify on zendesk
	
steps is very simple for Hostile Sub domain takeover 

1. you have to find a subdomain pointing to third party {is an alais of x.com}

2. make sure their service is inactive or cancelled or expired 

3. go that third party website register as client and when they will ask to point your subdomain you just give subdomain.com
